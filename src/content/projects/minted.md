# Overview

Minted is a personal finance application designed to simplify asset tracking and long-term wealth planning. Rather than focusing purely on budgeting or expense categorisation, the platform is structured around one core objective: helping users build and optimise assets over time.

The product was built to provide clarity in financial decision-making, with an emphasis on structured growth, long-term projection, and visual feedback

## Challenge

The personal finance space is saturated with tools that focus heavily on budgeting and expense tracking. While these features are valuable, many platforms lack clear long-term asset planning and optimisation tools.

The key challenges were:

Distinguishing the product from traditional budgeting apps

Creating a system that feels structured and relatable rather than overwhelming

Translating financial data into intuitive visual insights

Designing projection logic that remains accurate yet understandable

The goal was not to replace existing financial tools, but to complement them with a stronger focus on asset accumulation and forward planning.

## Solution

Minted was developed around a structured financial model that prioritises asset growth as the primary metric of success.

Key implementation decisions included:

Custom-built calculation algorithms to handle compound growth, contribution forecasting, and asset optimisation

Modular data processing to allow for future API integrations

Chart.js integration for dynamic, responsive data visualisation

A simplified input system that reduces friction while maintaining useful depth

The architecture separates calculation logic from presentation, ensuring scalability and maintainability as additional financial instruments and integrations are introduced.

## Outcome

Minted successfully demonstrates a clear product direction centred on long-term financial growth rather than short-term budgeting.

The current MVP supports:

Asset tracking

Growth projections

Visual performance breakdowns

Structured accumulation planning

An upcoming integration with a UK-based trading platform API will allow for automated portfolio syncing, reducing manual data entry and increasing accuracy.

The product is positioned for iterative development, with user feedback guiding future feature prioritisation and potential monetisation pathways
