# Overview

Forge Architecture is a locally based architectural practice focused on thoughtful residential design and small-scale commercial projects. The studio blends contemporary design principles with contextual sensitivity, delivering spaces that feel intentional, functional, and enduring.

The goal was to create a digital presence that reflects the precision and craft of the firm’s work while making it easy for prospective clients to explore services and initiate contact.

## Challenge

Forge Architecture operates in a competitive regional market where trust, clarity, and credibility are essential.

The primary challenges were:

Communicating expertise without overwhelming visitors

Showcasing completed projects in a refined, visual-first format

Positioning the studio as both design-led and technically competent

Making the enquiry process straightforward for residential clients unfamiliar with architectural services

The website needed to feel structured and confident — not flashy — and align with the firm's professional tone.

## Solution

The site was designed with a minimalist layout that prioritises project imagery and spatial storytelling. A clear typographic hierarchy and restrained colour palette were chosen to mirror architectural drawings and material palettes.

Key decisions included:

A project-driven homepage to immediately demonstrate capability

Clear service breakdowns outlining RIBA stages in accessible language

Dedicated case study pages for completed builds

A streamlined enquiry flow to reduce friction for new clients

The technical build focuses on performance and scalability, ensuring that the studio can easily expand its portfolio section as new projects are completed.

## Outcome

The result is a clean, professional digital presence that supports Forge Architecture’s reputation for precision and clarity.

The platform provides:

A scalable structure for future project additions

Improved client enquiry flow

A stronger visual identity aligned with the studio’s design philosophy

The site positions Forge Architecture as a contemporary, detail-oriented practice ready to take on residential and small commercial commissions.
